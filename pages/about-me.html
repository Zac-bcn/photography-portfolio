					<p>My name is Zac. I am a full stack developer in training with a passion for Photography and travel. The idea of being a developer has been in the back of my mind since I graduated college with a BA in Marketing. I never truly felt passionate about the field, but needed to graduate so I decided to stay on track to graduate on time versus changing my path completely.<br>
				 
					</br>I first fell in love with photography in high school. My friends and I were into action sports and we constantly captured our stunts on camera. My last year of high school I was a part of the year book team as a photographer. This furthered my interest and I could fine tune my skills working alongside other photographers. I highlight of this era was that my photo made it to the featured page at the beginning of the yearbook! My college years was a dry spell for photography. It wasn't until I graduated that I received at job at Auto Marketing Solutions taking photos of vehicles for advertisements. I then moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina where I became an event photographer for The Buenos Aires Pub Crawl. This was a great time of my life as I was living in a new city getting paid to party and meet new people. Eventually my interest died of taking pictures of drunk party goers, and in order not to move back the US took a sales position in Buenos Aires to finally start a career. At first it was nice because of the work life balance, but eventually it has become uninteresting and tiresome.<br> 

					</br>I am now following my dream to become a full stack developer. This is my first website/project. Photography is still as passion and hobby, and this site is meant to showcase some of my favorite photos I've taken throughout my travels. I tend to lean towards nature photography, and have recently gotten into street shooting. Enjoy and I encourage feedback.
